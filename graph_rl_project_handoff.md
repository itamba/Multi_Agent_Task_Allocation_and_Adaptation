# Multi-Agent Graph RL — Visual-Artifact Closure / Final-Cell Probe Handoff

**Supersedes all earlier handoffs.**

Written 2026-08-11; updated 2026-08-13 for the repository-hygiene closure below.
B1–B4, the first real post-B3 instrumented probe, the B4 observability follow-up (PR #7),
**FD-BASELINE-v1** (PR #8), **FINAL-CELL-VISUAL-ARTIFACTS** (PR #10) and the repository
code-hygiene cleanup (PR #11) are all CLOSED. Neither that cleanup nor this update changes
research behaviour, configuration, dependencies or workflows.

Baseline **difficulty selection is finished** and the **inspection surface for a probe is
now in place**. What has NOT happened is any measurement of the resulting cell. The next
task is a bounded short scientific probe of the merged fuel-damage configuration, before
any long baseline.

This handoff is volatile and deliberately thin. Technical contracts live in `CLAUDE.md`;
code and tests remain decisive. Where a fact is already in `CLAUDE.md` this document
cross-references it rather than duplicating it.

## 0. How this workspace reads the repository

- Repository access is capability-aware, not shared:
  - GPT resolves repository facts through GitHub first — branches, PRs, files and exact
    SHAs. GitHub is a search interface, not a filesystem.
  - Claude resolves facts through a synchronized mounted snapshot of `main` plus Git
    evidence CC reports. It can lag and cannot prove a historical diff on its own.
  - Either orchestrator asks one focused question only when its available access cannot
    establish a blocking fact.
- Tie every repository claim to an explicit full SHA. Read code, tests, `CLAUDE.md` and
  this handoff at that same SHA. Project Sources, memory, chat summaries and pasted
  narratives are not evidence of current repository state.
- Cite code by file + symbol or exact string, never by line number.
- `CLAUDE.md` §1 owns grading, transport, candidate review, fixes and status reporting.

  `14224531db9deb700f6e397203177eb8c701c6cc` (PR #4).
- **B4 preparation — CLOSED / MERGED / LOCKED.**
  `1b48145f4ba6ed542c27ab6ed7a9ea3e6f6ab12c`, merged by
  `ba936606deada050ed9298600ee9041fc330af6c` (PR #6).
- **First real post-B3 instrumented probe — CLOSED / REVIEWED MEASUREMENT of the
  PRE-FD cell.** Ran from the clean exact code SHA
  `a3f0838616990987bcb8a51665fa75d84edf5952`. §2 records what it measured and what it
  does NOT establish.
- **B4 per-episode observability follow-up — CLOSED / MERGED / LOCKED.**
  `211e12e49b676637362d42effdb80988dd0e55eb`, merged by
  `ffb95a6ee90df45b2d89802b321dcadcbc272821` (PR #7). Candidate
  `24241690572a7a5264e24348db5e9412b41bc47a` received REQUEST-FIXES; the approved
  correction was a new commit, never rewritten.
- **FD-BASELINE-v1 — CLOSED / MERGED / LOCKED, and it remains so.** Approved candidate
  `a8669f450708c2508753c49ab16fd1028b29607d`, integrated by
  `1cecb0ac99f839d47ffeea12c8871aec77e66640` (PR #8); the merged tree was independently
  verified identical to the approved candidate tree. The FIRST candidate
  `1cf53fcee3ee05b3466c8391cbc6bb04420a0985` received REQUEST-FIXES; the correction landed
  as a NEW CHILD COMMIT on the same branch and PR, with no amend, rebase, force-push or
  history rewrite. §3 summarizes the factor; `CLAUDE.md` §5 and §7 own the authoritative
  contract and lock. Nothing in the visual-artifact work below changed it.
- **FINAL-CELL-VISUAL-ARTIFACTS — CLOSED / MERGED / REVIEWED.** Approved candidate
  `24d1835f31d2e6aac04b418308a8753c392ac951`, integrated by
  `771f2107211fb3f984b64482b799613260e19aca` (PR #10); the merged tree was verified
  byte-identical to the approved candidate tree (`git diff --quiet 24d1835 771f210`).
  Grade A under `GPT_GITHUB`, mode SURGICAL, exactly two files
  (`src/match_aou/rl/training/graph_train.py`, `tests/test_graph_train.py`). §3b
  summarizes it; `CLAUDE.md` §5, §6 and §7 own the contract, routing and lock.
- **Repository code-hygiene cleanup — CLOSED / APPROVED / MERGED.** Approved candidate
  `2a3f89cf2d027581308493a98767ae658107d6d1`, integrated by
  `6e2757dd30100f429d492f4d23fd8b5f57cf4fac` (PR #11). Grade A under `GPT_GITHUB`, mode
  SURGICAL. The retired `blade_executor_minimal.py` is **removed from current `main`**, and
  its one live helper `nearest_neighbor_order` now lives in
  `src/match_aou/utils/scheduling_utils.py`, imported by BOTH `GraphPlanExecutor._eligible`
  and `graph_hidden_placement.predict_route` — so online execution and offline route
  prediction still share exactly ONE implementation. Verified no behaviour change: placement
  geometry and executor eligibility were byte-identical to the pre-merge base over seed and
  world sweeps, full suite 216 passed / 4 skipped, import purity 12/12. No training,
  rollout, BONMIN solve or scientific probe was run. `CLAUDE.md` §7 owns the lock.

- **No scientific probe or training run has been performed on the merged final cell.**
  Every test behind both locks is solver-free and drives the pipeline through stubbed
  engine seams. The locks certify implementation; they say nothing about how the cell
  behaves.
- **Repository documentation hygiene — CLOSED / APPROVED / MERGED.** Approved candidate
  `52064c2d306df7c8447d159df20e6e189a59bf85`, integrated by
  `5f78904e3af1e2e47386c9b0e01ddbaa273724f5` (PR #12); the approved candidate tree was
  verified identical to the integration tree. Grade C, documents and dead data only —
  `README.md` replaced, `docs/BLADE_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` audited against the vendored
  fork, four obsolete scenario JSONs and two dead utility symbols removed. It changed no
  research behaviour. The FIRST candidate `6302847bdc8b5e40313763b4b167af85dd0a462e`
  received REQUEST-FIXES; the correction landed as a new child commit, never rewritten.
  `CLAUDE.md` §7 owns the lock.
- **Repository hygiene is now COMPLETE, and NO active candidate or open task PR remains.**
  Both hygiene tasks are merged (PR #11 code, PR #12 documentation) and their branches
  `task/repo-code-hygiene` and `task/repo-doc-hygiene` have been **deleted** locally and
  remotely by safe deletion, each verified an ancestor of `main` first; every reviewed
  candidate tip stays reachable on GitHub through `refs/pull/<n>/head`. The earlier
  implementation branch `task/final-cell-visual-artifacts` was likewise verified and
  deleted. `flat-final` (`4d44c3454a5561a6cb9d7aed593d59a40068d6d7`) and the `pre-cleanup`
  tag (peeling to `561b7cb7f2d873e584a8c0dabe71df8050f1b4ed`) are untouched.
  **Ownership is RELEASED.** The next orchestrator performs fresh exact-SHA initialization:
  **resolve the current full `main` SHA from the repository** rather than reusing any SHA
  named in this document.

## 2. Historical probe — evidence about the EASY PRE-FD cell only

Measured code: exact clean SHA `a3f0838616990987bcb8a51665fa75d84edf5952`. Shape: two
iterations × four scheduled train attempts, seeds `[0,8)`, with the same fixed four
held-out seeds `[1000000,1000004)` before training and after two completed updates.

- Provenance complete (exact SHA, `dirty=false`, Windows / `nlp_env`, vendored BLADE,
  BONMIN); the run completed normally in 79.21 s.
- `pre_update`, `updates_completed=0`: reward mean `-0.4999997395829586`, **4/4**.
- Training **7/8** successful, all with wakes; **24 transitions**; two productive
  iterations and two PPO updates. The single failure was train seed 2 at `setup` — B2
  produced two placements for three requested hidden targets — attempted once, recorded
  once, never retried or replaced.
- `post_update`, `updates_completed=2`: reward mean `5.000007394910353e-7`, **4/4**.
- `run_summary.json:accounting_reconciled=true`; all six durable artifacts existed.
- Evidence SHA-256 for the six artifacts is recorded in `CLAUDE.md` §7 under `a3f0838`.

**That cell contained NO difficulty factor.** It is preserved as historical evidence that
the pipeline collects data and updates, and that the easy cell had headroom the loop could
close. It is **not** a baseline, and it is **not** evidence about the fuel-damage cell —
those numbers must never be reused as the new cell's expected behaviour, and the probe in
§4 must not be judged against them.

## 3. What PR #8 closed — FD-BASELINE-v1

Authoritative contract: `CLAUDE.md` §5 ("FD-BASELINE-v1 — the difficulty factor") and §4
for the tick placement. Lock, fix chain and verification: `CLAUDE.md` §7 under `a8669f4`.
Summarized here only far enough to hand over.

**The selected factor and its research role.** The pre-FD cell was learned in a two-update
probe: the static plan already sat close to the oracle, and the only adaptation on offer
was engaging a pop-up the ego happened to fly past. FD-BASELINE-v1 adds exactly ONE
attributable source of adaptation difficulty — a seeded, ego-local, one-shot fuel-damage
event partway along an ego's first planned leg, sized so that flying home stays feasible
while completing the route and returning does not. That turns `SELF_PRESERVATION_ABORT`
from a never-correct action into a live alternative, and the explicit
`RewardConfig(aircraft_penalty_coeff=2.25)` is what gives losing the airframe a cost.

**The scenario cell is otherwise unchanged**: 3 agents, 3 known + 3 route-relative hidden
airbase targets, 200 km / 100 km geometry, `DETECTION_KM = 50`, `include_sams=False`,
`probability = 1`, unchanged BLADE weapon lethality, frozen solver, unchanged PPO, and the
`graph_reward` formula untouched.

**Deferred, NOT bundled.** `probability < 1`, enemy fire / SAMs and dense (per-wake) reward
were considered and **not selected**. Each remains a separate research change with its own
semantics, observability and proof obligations, and none may be enabled implicitly — see
`CLAUDE.md` §8. In particular `p` remains 1, so the reward operand scale is not reopened.

**Verification at the approved head** (`CLAUDE.md` §7 has the full statement): full suite
192 passed / 4 skipped, 35 fuel-damage tests, 73 graph-train tests, import purity 12/12,
`graph_trigger` selftest green, `git diff --check` clean.

## 3b. What PR #10 closed — FINAL-CELL-VISUAL-ARTIFACTS

Authoritative contract: `CLAUDE.md` §5 ("Visual artifacts — the opt-in inspection
surface"); routing in §6; lock and verification in §7 under `24d1835`. Summarized here
only far enough to hand over.

**What it is for.** A finished probe is otherwise a directory of numbers. With
`TrainConfig.visual_artifacts` / `--visual-artifacts` enabled, every scheduled
`pre_update` / `train` / `post_update` attempt keeps one collision-free bundle under
`<run_dir>/visual_artifacts/`: the byte-identical generated known-only scenario, the
authoritative executed t=0 scenario taken from `ctx.game.export_scenario()` on the env-2
game before the fuel-damage controller exists, the BLADE playback produced through the
existing `setup_episode(recording_export_path=...)` + `run_episode` contract, and an
`artifact_manifest.json` stating phase, iteration, `updates_completed`, ordinals, exact
seed, scheduled condition and exact scenario tag. A whole bundle is `complete`; a bundle
left behind by a failed attempt is clearly marked `incomplete`.

**What it is not.** It is observation, not measurement. Nothing captured is read back into
the pipeline. **OFF by default, and OFF is byte-unchanged** — no directory, no identity, no
copy, no `Game.export_scenario` call, and neither the `recording_export_path` nor the
`artifacts` keyword is passed at all. No seed, scenario tag, scenario name, RNG draw,
policy inference, PPO input, solver input, reward, fuel-damage semantic, failure taxonomy
or BLADE behaviour changed.

**Failure routing.** An artifact filesystem / serialization failure is INFRASTRUCTURE:
`_VisualArtifactError` is re-raised ahead of the broad episode handlers, aborts the run
loudly, and never enters `skip_and_account_v1` or `episode_failures.jsonl`, so it cannot
shrink a scientific denominator by masquerading as an episode failure.

**Verification at the approved head** (`CLAUDE.md` §7 has the full statement):
`tests/test_graph_train.py` 89 passed in BOTH environments, setup-seam + fuel-damage
regressions 66 passed / 4 skipped, import purity 12/12, full suite 208 passed / 4 skipped,
`git diff --check` clean, plus three mutation checks confirming the load-bearing tests
falsify.

**No live BLADE/BONMIN probe, training run, rollout, artifact-generating smoke or
scientific baseline was performed** for either PR #8 or PR #10.

## 4. Next task — a bounded SHORT SCIENTIFIC PROBE of the merged fuel-damage cell

Start with fresh exact-SHA initialization against the new `main`. **This documentation
task neither authorizes nor runs the probe.** The probe's exact CLI/config, seed bands,
pass/fail reading rules and local PyCharm execution procedure MUST be closed in the next
chat, BEFORE the run.

**Intended shape, to be confirmed and made exact before execution:**

- 2 training iterations;
- 4 scheduled training attempts per iteration;
- four fixed held-out seeds;
- matched forced-clean and forced-damaged members, run BEFORE training (`pre_update`) and
  AFTER training (`post_update`) on the same held-out seeds;
- live console output (the per-episode `OK` blocks and the per-iteration / per-round
  lines);
- visual artifacts ENABLED — the flag selects every scheduled attempt, so a successful one
  yields a `complete` bundle and a failed one a clearly marked `incomplete` bundle.

**Execution discipline.** Run it ONCE, from a clean checkout at an exact resolved `main`
SHA, with COMPLETE Git provenance (`train` refuses otherwise — `CLAUDE.md` §8), on the
merged cell as configured: no ad-hoc knob changes, no second difficulty factor, no retry
of a failed seed, no band shift.

**Report, all with explicit denominators:**

- complete provenance and the exact resolved configuration;
- scheduled **clean vs damaged** attempt populations and their successes/failures;
- **matched-pair yield** and the paired reward delta over pairs whose BOTH members
  completed, next to its pair denominator;
- **failures by pipeline stage** (`generation` / `setup` / `run` / `reward`), including any
  `setup` planning refusal and any `run`-stage live-window refusal;
- per-episode **event fired / wake / real RTB command / death** outcomes;
- reward headroom, and whether the PPO updates were productive;
- **artifact completeness** — how many selected attempts produced a `complete` bundle and
  how many an `incomplete` one, reported ALONGSIDE the scientific denominators and never
  in place of one.

**A long baseline remains UNAUTHORIZED until the short probe has been reviewed.**
Interpretation rules survive unchanged: a held-out mean is never read without its
denominator; an all-failed batch reports `null`, never `0.0`; and an empty
successful-pair population is `null` too. **Do not pre-claim any probe result**, and do not
reuse the §2 numbers as its expectation.

## 5. Closed decisions

- Offline construction only: solve → place → patch → reload.
- Route prediction is required and supports `num_agents < n_known`.
- One sensing/arrival/attack/kill-confirmation radius: `DETECTION_KM = 50`.
- `round_trip_cost` and the current p=1 `graph_reward` FORMULA remain frozen.
- B1 reference cell: 3 agents, 3 known, 3 hidden; strict 200 km launch-point distance,
  100 km known-target separation and 0.5 stretch ratio. A reference cell, not a law.
- B2: one placement per non-empty ego route, explicit `random.Random`, id-free geometric
  fingerprints and one-way placement-layer imports.
- B3: explicit construction-path selection; env-2 is the runtime source of truth;
  ordered agent IDs survive reload; exact cardinality; airbase-only cell.
- B4: complete provenance precondition, `skip_and_account_v1`, fixed held-out band,
  explicit denominators, six run artifacts, true pre-update evaluation and disjoint
  all-failed / zero-wake / productive states.
- PR #7: per-episode `OK` blocks, direct unique-target-id counts, accounted structural
  roster failures and disjoint per-round eval artifact namespaces.
- PR #8 (FD-BASELINE-v1): fuel damage is the ONE selected difficulty factor; deterministic
  private RNG domain; matched forced-clean / forced-damaged evaluation pairs on the same
  held-out seed; the strict window validated twice (planned, then live before mutation);
  RTB measured from real emitted command history, never from `GraphPlanExecutor.rtb_issued`;
  explicit `aircraft_penalty_coeff = 2.25` with the reward formula unchanged.
- PR #10 (FINAL-CELL-VISUAL-ARTIFACTS): artifact capture is opt-in and OFF by default; it
  selects every scheduled attempt rather than a per-seed subset; the executed t=0 snapshot
  comes from env-2 before the controller and the run; recording is armed only through the
  existing setup/tick-loop contract; artifact failures are infrastructure and stay outside
  the scientific ledger.
- The legacy split surface remains retained, not retired.

## 6. Out of scope for the next task

- a long training run before the final-cell probe passes;
- selecting or enabling a SECOND difficulty factor (`probability < 1`, hostile fire/SAMs,
  dense reward) — each is its own research change;
- reworking the merged FD-BASELINE-v1 mechanism or the merged visual-artifact surface, or
  their reviewed research decisions;
- extending artifact capture (per-seed filters, new artifact kinds, artifact-derived
  metrics) — the probe uses what is merged;
- checkpoint loading/resume;
- centralized critic / CTDE;
- low-known-cell solver timeout unless the chosen cell needs `known ≤ 2`;
- ETA/peer-dropout, reachability-model and legacy-split retirement work;
- further repository/documentation hygiene — the README rewrite and the BLADE fork
  documentation audit were closed by PR #11's follow-up hygiene task, and the probe
  neither needs nor may reopen them.

## 8. Next action

Implementation for the final Phase-A baseline cell is COMPLETE and locked, its inspection
surface is merged, and repository hygiene is CLOSED (PR #11 code, PR #12 documentation).
No active candidate, task branch or open task PR remains, and **ownership is RELEASED**.

The next orchestrator performs fresh exact-SHA initialization against the current `main`,
closes the probe's exact configuration and execution procedure per §4, and only then runs
it once. The next task is still the bounded SHORT SCIENTIFIC PROBE of the merged
fuel-damage cell described in §4 — unchanged by the hygiene work — and the long baseline
remains UNAUTHORIZED until that probe passes.

No branch is awaiting cleanup.

**This document authorizes neither an implementation nor a training run.**
